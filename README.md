# Introduction

In this experiment, my group will be using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as our NoSQL setup.

We will be comparing the query speed between encrypted vs non-encrypted setup.


# Installation

MongoDB can be installed on Windows using the following Winget command:

Launch your Terminal/Powershell and paste the following code:

```
winget install MongoDB.Server
```
